# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves optimizing PDF generation by implementing aggressive image size reduction to minimize file size while maintaining acceptable visual quality. Currently, PDF files generated by the system are too large due to unoptimized images, making them difficult to share and store efficiently. The system needs to automatically reduce image sizes as much as possible during PDF generation to create the smallest manageable files.

## Glossary

- **PDF Generation System**: The backend service responsible for creating PDF documents
- **Image Scaling**: The process of resizing images to the smallest possible dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio and readability
- **Payload Size**: The total file size of the generated PDF document
- **Image Optimization**: Aggressive techniques used to minimize image file size while preserving essential visual quality
- **Maximum Size Reduction**: The approach of reducing images to the smallest possible size that maintains document usability

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want PDF files to have optimized file sizes, so that they can be efficiently stored, transmitted, and downloaded by users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a PDF is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure the total file size is minimized through image optimization
2. WHEN images are included in PDFs THEN the system SHALL scale them to reduce payload size
3. WHEN PDF generation completes THEN the system SHALL produce files that are significantly smaller than unoptimized versions
4. WHEN multiple images are processed THEN the system SHALL apply consistent optimization across all images
5. WHEN file size limits are approached THEN the system SHALL prioritize image optimization to stay within bounds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all images in PDFs to be automatically reduced to the smallest possible size, so that file sizes are minimized while maintaining usability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is processed for PDF inclusion THEN the system SHALL reduce it to the smallest possible size while maintaining readability
2. WHEN scaling images THEN the system SHALL maintain aspect ratio to prevent distortion
3. WHEN images are already small THEN the system SHALL still apply compression and optimization techniques
4. WHEN images have different aspect ratios THEN the system SHALL optimize each to its smallest usable size
5. WHEN aggressive optimization is applied THEN the system SHALL preserve essential visual information for document purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want PDF images to remain visually acceptable after optimization, so that the documents are still useful and professional-looking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are scaled THEN the system SHALL maintain sufficient quality for document readability
2. WHEN aspect ratios are preserved THEN the system SHALL prevent image distortion or stretching
3. WHEN compression is applied THEN the system SHALL balance file size reduction with visual quality
4. WHEN multiple image formats are processed THEN the system SHALL handle them consistently
5. WHEN images contain text or detailed graphics THEN the system SHALL ensure they remain legible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the image optimization process to be configurable and maintainable, so that it can be adjusted based on changing requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimization parameters are configured THEN the system SHALL use centralized configuration values for maximum size reduction
2. WHEN optimization settings are changed THEN the system SHALL apply them consistently across all PDF generation
3. WHEN different image types are processed THEN the system SHALL apply format-specific aggressive optimization
4. WHEN optimization fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback behavior and error handling
5. WHEN performance monitoring is needed THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on size reduction effectiveness
